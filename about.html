  <h1>About Me</h1>

    Hello! I’m Ezethu Gaxo, an aspiring cloud and data professional based in Cape Town, 
    South Africa. I hold a BSc in Statistics and am currently working towards my Honours 
    degree in Mathematics.

  <p>
    I have experience in academic research, data preparation, and analysis, working with 
    tools like Python, SQL, Power BI, SPSS, and Excel. I am passionate about leveraging 
    data and cloud technologies to solve real-world problems.

    Currently, I am focused on learning cloud computing fundamentals through the 
    AWS Cloud Practitioner Essentials course. I’m excited to build practical skills 
    and earn certifications that will help me grow my career in technology.

    curious about new ways to learn and share knowledge.
